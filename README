yaml-glib - Building GObject from YAML

Introduction
===========
yaml-glib is the GLib binding of libyaml, plus a GObject builder
that understands YAML.

Source
=======
  The source code is hosted at github:

  $ git clone git://github.com/fengy-research/libyaml-glib.git

  No released tarball is available currently.


Dependencies
============

  glib2 >= 2.10            GLib and GObject 
  valac >= 0.7.2           Vala compiler

  libyaml == 0.1.2         YAML 1.1 parser
    built into the source tree, considering its current availability.

Install
=======
  The header files and libraries of libyaml are also installed.

  1. Direct install (on most distributions)

  $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr
  $ make
  $ make install

  2. Build RPM and install from the rpm

  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ make
  $ make dist

The next step either requires your rpmdevtree is properly setup
  $ rpmbuild -ta yaml-glib-0.1.tar.gz

Or you can build the rpm with `easybuild'
  (obtained from http://github.com/fengy-research/easybuild)

  $ easybuild -ba yaml-glib.spec

And the built RPMs will be in the current directory:

  $ ls *.rpm
  yaml-glib-0.1-5.i386.rpm  yaml-glib-debuginfo-0.1-5.i386.rpm
  yaml-glib-0.1-5.src.rpm   yaml-glib-devel-0.1-5.i386.rpm

Install the package with
  $ su -c 'rpm -U yaml-glib-0.1-5.i386.rpm \
    yaml-glib-debuginfo-0.1-5.i386.rpm \
    yaml-glib-devel-0.1-5.i386.rpm'

Documentation
=============
  The documenation can be compiled from valadoc. If a valadoc 
  compiler is available. No documentation is installed. It is recommended
  to turn off the documentation with --disable-valadoc all the time until
  valadoc is stable.
